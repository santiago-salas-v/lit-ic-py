Suitable conventions are applied to different solutions: Convention I is useful for solutions of miscible liquids at T,P (e.g. ethanol/water). Conventions II, III, and IV are useful for solutions of components that are gases or solids at T,P (e.g. oxygen or sugar in water). \\
Convention I: Each component approaches ideality as its mole fraction approaches unity.
\begin{equation}
\textnormal{component (i): } (\gamma_i \rightarrow 1) as  (x_i \rightarrow 1)\\
\end{equation}
Convention II: Ideal solvent as it approaches unit mole fraction; ideal solutes at \textit{infinite dilution}, expressed in mole fraction.\\
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\textnormal{solvent (0): } & (\gamma_0 \rightarrow 1) as  (x_0 \rightarrow 1)\\
\textnormal{solute (i): } & (\gamma_i \rightarrow 1) as (x_i \rightarrow 0)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Convention III: Ideal solvent as it approaches unit mole fraction; ideal solutes at \textit{infinite dilution}, expressed in molality. \\
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\textnormal{solvent (0): } & (\gamma_0 \rightarrow 1) as  (x_0 \rightarrow 1)\\
\textnormal{solute (i): } & (\gamma_i \rightarrow 1) as (m_i \rightarrow 0)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Convention IV: Ideal solutes at \textit{infinite dilution}, expressed in molarity. \\
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\textnormal{solute (i): } & (\gamma_i \rightarrow 1) as (c_i \rightarrow 0)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Chemical potential expressed under each convention, with $m_i^{\circ}$ and $c_i^{\circ}$selected as reference solute states at unit molality, and molarity respectively.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mu_i = & \mu_i^{*} + RTln(\gamma_i^{I} x_i) \\
	= 	& \mu_i^{*} + RTln(\gamma_i^{II} x_i) \\
	=	& \mu_i^{\fbox{}} + RTln(\gamma_i^{III} m_i/m_i^{\circ}) \\
	= 	& \mu_i^{\diamond} + RTln(\gamma_i^{IV} c_i/c_i^{\circ})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Notes on conversion between conventions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Values of activity coefficients $\gamma_i^{II}$ and $\gamma_i^{III}$ vary, but chemical potential does not vary due to convention selection.
\item Reference states chemical potentials under each convention $\mu_i^{*}$ and $\mu_i^{\fbox{}}$  are functions of temperature and pressure exclusively. Their difference calculated at infinite dilution does not change at other compositions:
\end{itemize}
\[
\mu_i^{*} - \mu_i^{\fbox{}}  =  func(T,P) =  \lim_{x_0 \to 1} \left( \mu_i^{*} - \mu_i^{\fbox{}}\right) 
\]
\[
RTln\left[ \frac{\gamma_i^{III} m_i/m_i^{\circ}}{\gamma_i^{II} x_i}\right] = \lim_{x_0 \to 1} RTln\left[ \frac{\gamma_i^{III} m_i/m_i^{\circ}}{\gamma_i^{II} x_i}\right] 
\]
Therefore, referring back to conventions II and III, $\gamma_i \rightarrow 1$ at \textit{infinite dilution}:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\gamma_i^{III} m_i/m_i^{\circ}}{\gamma_i^{II} x_i} & = \lim_{x_0 \to 1} \frac{\gamma_i^{III} m_i/m_i^{\circ}}{\gamma_i^{II} x_i} = \frac{1}{m_i^0} \times \lim_{x_0 \to 1} \frac{x_i}{m_i} \\
& = \frac{1}{m_i^0} \times \lim_{x_0 \to 1} \left[ \frac{n_i/ \left(\frac{n_i}{n_0 M_0}\right)}{n_0+\sum_{j \neq 0}n_j} \right] \\
& = \frac{1}{m_i^\circ M_0}
\end{aligned}
\]
This leads to the following relationship between activity coefficients calculated by each convention:
\begin{equation}
\gamma_i^{II} = \gamma_i^{III} \times \frac{m_i M_0}{x_i}
\end{equation}
A standard form of equation is obtained by assuming complete dissociation of a solute $A_0$ into $\nu$ components, so that for all solutes the sum of molalities can be expressed as $\sum_{j \neq 0}m_j = \nu m_j $:
\[
A \rightleftharpoons A_1 + A_2 + A_2 + ... + A_{\nu}
\]
Combined with Table \ref{table:composition_expr}, the matching expression presented in \cite{Hamer1968} is obtained:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\gamma_i^{II} & =  \gamma_i^{III} \times \frac{\left( \frac{n_i M_0}{n_0 M_0}\right) \times (n_0 + \sum_{j\neq0}{n_j}) }{n_i} = \gamma_i^{III} \times \left(1+\sum_{j\neq0}{m_j M_0} \right) \\ 
\gamma_i^{II} & = \gamma_i^{III} \times \left(1+\frac{\nu m M_0}{1000 \frac{g}{kg}} \right)
\end{aligned}
\]
